sqlite3
=======
Creating a new database:
	sqlite3 mydatabase.db

Creating a new table with columns:
	CREATE TABLE students (
	  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	  name TEXT,
	  age INTEGER,
	  grade INTEGER
	);

Inserting data into a table:
	INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade) VALUES
	  ('Alice', 17, 95),
	  ('Bob', 16, 82),
	  ('Charlie', 18, 88);

Updating data in a table:
	UPDATE students SET grade = 90 WHERE name = 'Bob';

Deleting data from a table:
	DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 3;

Selecting all data from a table:
	SELECT * FROM students;

Selecting data from a table with conditions:
	SELECT * FROM students WHERE age >= 17;

Counting rows in a table:
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;

Sorting data in a table:
	SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY grade DESC;

Joining data from multiple tables:
	SELECT students.name, classes.name FROM students
	  JOIN classes ON students.id = classes.student_id;
