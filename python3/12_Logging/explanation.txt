Logging serves two purposes:
    1. Diagnostic logging
        - This logging records events related to the application's operation.
        - If a user calls in to report an error, for example, the logs can be searched for context.
    2. Audit logging
        - Audit logging records events for business analysis.
        - A userâ€™s transactions (such as a clickstream) can be extracted and combined with other user
          details (such as eventual purchases) for reports or to optimize a business goal.
