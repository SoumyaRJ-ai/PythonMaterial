Python Interview Questions  & their answers
============================================
Q1) What is the purpose of python decorators, and how can they be used?
Ans) Generally, functions are used for code reusability.
    Decorators are the functions used to handle redundant code among
    multiple functions.

    WITHOUT decorator:
    ------------------
    def add(a, b):
        try:
            result = a + b
        except Exception as ex:
            return ex
        else:
            return result

    def div(n1, n2):
        try:
            result = n1 / n2
        except Exception as ex:
            return ex
        else:
            return result

    WITH decorator:
    ---------------

    def handle_expection(func):
        def inner(v1, v2):
            try:
                result = func(v1, v2)
                # print(f'{func =}')
            except Exception as ex:
                return ex
            else:
                return result
        return inner

    @handle_expection
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @handle_expection
    def div(n1, n2):
        return n1 / n2

Q2)	What is the purpose of the property decorator?
Ans) In a class, to access a method as a variable, we need property decorator.
    property decorator comes with attributes:
         getter()  --> To retrieve a method as a variable
         setter()  --> To set the value to the method
         deletter()--> Executes when "del" operator is invoked against this method

Q3) What is the purpose of PYTHONPATH, and how do you modify it?
Ans) It is an environment variable, storing directory where python looks for
    modules & packages. For recent installations, it will be automatically set, during
    python installation.

Q4) Which builtin types are mutable/immutable?
Ans) Mutable objects - objects which support changes(add/modify/delete) on them
        Ex: list, dict, set , ordinary class instance
     Immutable objects - objects which doesnt support changes on them
        Ex: tuple, frozenset, instance of class with __slots__ defined

Q5) What is the purpose of *args and **kwargs?
Ans) variadic functions - functions which support any number of arguments.
    *args - defining it in function definition means to take any no. of arguments
           in function calls; all given elements will be part of a tuple.
    **kwargs - defining it in function definition means to take any no. of keyword
           arguments in function calls; all given elements will be part of dictionary.

    EXAMPLE:
    ===========
        def my_func(arg1, *arg2, **arg3):
            pass

        my_func(10, 1, '1', 'a', a='apple', b=True)

    Here,  arg1 (mandatory argument) will store 10
           arg2 (variable argument)  will store (1, '1', 'a')
           arg3 (variable keyword argument) will store {'a': 'apple', 'b': True}

Q6) How do you get current working dir in python?
Ans) using below code:
        import os
        print("current working directory:", os.getcwd())

Q7) How do you use ABCs? What contexts are they suitable for?
Ans) ABC - abstract base class
    In project, when we want to create child classes, which should all have
    same methods (like a template of methods), those abc classes will be
    created and inherited in all the child classes.
    This will ensure all the child classes with have same method names.

Q8) Whatâ€™s a list/dict comprehension? How do you create them? How do you filter items?
Ans) comprehension is writing the for loop code in single line.
    Example:
        even_nums = [num for num in range(10) if num % 2 == 0] # list comprehension
        even_nums = {num for num in range(10) if num % 2 == 0} # set comprehension
        even_nums = {num:num * num for num in range(10) if num % 2 == 0} # dict comprehension

    As shown above, if the elements are stored in key, value pairs and placed within {} braces,
    it is a dictionary comprehension.

Q9) How do you create a nested comprehension? How does it compare to for loops?
Ans) Nexted comprehension is placement of multiple for loops within same statement.
    Example:
        Method 1 (traditional):
            values = []
            for c in "aeiou":
                for num in range(5):
                    if num % 2 == 0:
                        values.append(f'{c}:{num}')
        Method 2 (using comprehensions):
            values = [f'{c}:{num}' for c in "aeiou" for num in range(5) if num % 2 == 0]

Q10) How do you sort a list? How about a list of dicts by one of the dict fields?
     How about multiple fields?
Ans) A list can be sorted using list.sort() attribute, or using sorted() builtin function
       list.sort() - sorting with be inline on same object
       sorted(list)- new list object is created with sorted values

    Example:
        my_list = [{'name': 'John', 'age': 12, 'sex': 'male'},
                    {'name': 'Jessi', 'age': 32, 'sex': 'female'},
                    {'name': 'Jack', 'age': 34, 'sex': 'male'}]

        sorted(my_list, key=lambda obj: obj['name'])

Q11) Given a list of dictionaries with keys "firstName" and "lastName", return the
     same list in ascending order of "lastName", then in ascending order of
     "firstName" for equal last names.
Ans) sorted(my_list, key=lambda dt: (dt['lastName'], dt['firstName'])

Q12) Given a string, return a dictionary where the keys are characters in the
    string and the values count the number of occurrences of the character.
Ans)
    given_string = "abbbabababbabakjhkjassa"

    METHOD 1: using setdefault

        counts = {}
        for each_char in given_string:
            counts.setdefault(each_char, 0)
            counts[each_char] += 1
        print(counts)

    METHOD 2: using collections.defaultdict

        from collections import defaultdict
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        for each_chr in given_string:
            counts[each_chr] += 1
        print(counts)

Q13) += operation on list of strings
Ans)
    >>> a = ['yes']
    >>> a + 'no'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "str") to list
    >>>
    >>> a += 'no'
    >>> a
    ['yes', 'n', 'o']
    >>>
Q14) Global namespace leak in python2
Ans)
    In Python2.7,
        num = 5
        print num # 5
        mylist = [num for num in range(9)]
        print num # 8
    In python3,
        num = 5
        print(num) # 5
        mylist = [num for num in range(9)]
        print(num) # 5

Q15) Problem with appending to the iterating list
Ans)
    >>> x = ['ab', 'cd']
    >>> for i in x:
    ...     x.append(i.upper())
    ... print(x)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
    MemoryError

Q16)
    def foo(x):
		x[0] = ['def']
		x[1] = ['abc']
		return id(x)

    q = ['abc', 'def']
    print(id(q) == foo(q))
Ans) True
