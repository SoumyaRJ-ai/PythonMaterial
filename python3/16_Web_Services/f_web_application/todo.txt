"""
Send an API request to /api/emplist to extract the employee hierarchy and
help to find the managers and number of reportees to each manager

Sample API Response :

{
    "emp_list":[
        { "A":"C" },
        { "B": "C" },
        { "C": "F" },
        { "D": "E" },
        { "E": "F" },
        { "F": "F" }
    ]
}

In this example C is manager of A,
C is also manager of B, F is manager of C and so on.


Write a function to get no of employees under each manager in the hierarchy
not just their direct reports.
It may be assumed that an employee directly reports to only one manager.
In the above dictionary the root node/ceo is listed as reporting to himself.

Output should be a Dictionary that contains following.

A - 0
B - 0
C - 2
D - 0
E - 1
F - 5
