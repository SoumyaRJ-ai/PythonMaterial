"""
Purpose: Synchronization using SemaPhores

    - Semaphores are simply advanced counters.
    - An acquire() call to a semaphore will block only after a number of threads have
      acquire()ed it.
    - The associated counter decreases per acquire() call, and increases per release() call.
    - A ValueError will occur if release() calls try to increment the counter beyond
      it's assigned maximum value (which is the number of threads that can acquire()
      the semaphore before blocking occurs).
    - Semaphores are typically used for limiting a resource, like limiting a server to
      handle only 10 clients at a time. In such a case, multiple thread connections compete
      for a limited resource.

    - A semaphore manages an internal counter which is decremented by each acquire()
      call and incremented by each release() call.

Following code demonstrates the use of semaphores in a simple producer-consumer problem.
