To decompile compiled pyc/pyo files to see original code, 
    Installation:
        pip install uncompyle6
    
    USAGE:
        uncompyle6 -o . <file-name.pc> 
    ex:
        uncompyl6 -o . txfile.pyc rxfile.pyc

    Instead of saving as py file, if you want to see in terminal,
         uncompyle6 <filename.pyc>
